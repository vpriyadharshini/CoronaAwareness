    <h1>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public</h1>

    <p>If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!</p>

<h1>How to make your environment safer </h1>

<h2>Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.  <img class="flat" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/3480/3480216.png" alt=""></h2>
<p class="content"><img class="flat1" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/3233/3233474.png" alt="">Outbreaks have been reported in restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship where people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing.</p>
<br>
<p class="content"><img class="flat1" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/3233/3233474.png" alt="">The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity.</p>
<br>
<p class="content"><img class="flat1" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/3233/3233474.png" alt=""> These environments are where the virus appears to spread by respiratory droplets or aerosols more efficiently, so taking precautions is even more important.</p>
<br>
<p class="content"><img class="flat1" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/3233/3233474.png" alt="">Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces are small and without outdoor air coming in.</p>

<h1>What to do to keep yourself and others safe from COVID-19</h1>
<img class="distance"src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/2949/2949697.png" alt="">
<p style="text-align:center">Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better.</p>
<img class="flat distance" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/2950/2950157.png" alt="">
<p  style="text-align:center">Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible.</p>
